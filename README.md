A customised implementation of the AutoVC model. The original implementation from which this repository was built can be found [here](https://github.com/auspicious3000/autovc)

Changes include:
    Corrections to tensor shapes
    Improved L1Loss implementation
    Customisation to work with the VTCK speech dataset
    Adaptations to work with vocal technique embeddings instead of speaker id embeddings
    Inclusion of a vocal technique classifier model for VTE generation
    a VTE lookup table
    Jupyter notebooks to provide walkthroughs of the different processes used
